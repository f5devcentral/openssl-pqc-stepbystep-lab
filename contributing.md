First off... the F5 DevCentral Community team thanks you for considering contributing to this project! We're excited to have you here.

By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it before getting started - it helps keep our community welcoming and respectful for everyone.

## Issues

Issues are incredibly valuable to this project.

- **Ideas** are a valuable source of contributions others can make
- **Problems** show where this project is lacking
- **Questions** show where we can improve the user experience

Thank you for creating them. This is a great way to contact us about the content within this repository.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository. Here's how we handle them:

### The Fork and Pull Model

Please use the fork and pull request workflow:

1. **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine
3. Create a new branch for your changes
4. Make your changes and commit them
5. **Push** to your fork
6. Submit a **pull request** from your fork back to this repository

We don't accept direct branch pushes to the main repository - forking keeps things clean and organized!

### Commit Messages Matter

Your commit messages should tell a story. Be concise but provide context.

**Bad commit message:**

```bash
fixed stuff
```

**Good commit message:**

```bash
Fix login validation to handle empty email fields

Adds check for empty email input before form submission to prevent
unnecessary API calls and improve user feedback
```

We shouldn't have to play detective to figure out what you changed or why. Future you (and everyone else) will thank present you.

### Quality Checklist

When we review pull requests, we look at the following:

#### Does it state intent?

Be clear about which problem you're solving.

For example:

> Update README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that.

> Update README.md to include installation instructions for Windows users

Tells me the problem you've found and how you're solving it.

#### Is it of good quality?

- Try to keep spelling mistakes down to a minimum, or none if you want to be an overachiever.
- Reads well for our F5 community at large, across the globe.
- Code is clean and commented where necessary
- For documentation: consider running it through a grammar checking tool or review what we've already posted as a guideline
- You are contributing and not your preferred AI content mill. We too will use AI to assist us but we're all here to learn, not to see how much content we can crank out. Quality not quantity.

#### Does it follow our style guide?

All contributions should follow our [Style Guide](style_guide.md). This keeps the codebase consistent and maintainable.

*Note: If you don't see a style guide in this repository yet, stay tuned - we're working on it! In the meantime, try to match the existing code style.*

#### Does it align with the project vision?

The aim of this repository is:

- [My Goal]
- [Your goal]
- [Jason's goal]

If your contribution moves us closer to these goals, that's fantastic!

### Does it follow the Code of Conduct?

This repository has a [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). Contributions that don't respect it will be removed. We're here to build great things together, and that requires mutual respect.

## Questions?

If you're unsure about anything, just ask! Open an issue with your question or reach out to the maintainers. We're here to help.
