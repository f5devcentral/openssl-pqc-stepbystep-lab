# Code of Conduct

We're building something fun at F5 DevCentral, and we need your help to keep our community welcoming and productive. Here's what we expect from all community members:

## Our Standards

* **Be respectful**: Treat fellow community members with courtesy and respect. We have zero tolerance for offensive comments related to gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or any other personal characteristic. Harassment, intimidation, threats, unwelcome sexual attention, doxxing, or deliberate attempts to make others uncomfortable have no place here.

* **Encourage diversity and participation**: We welcome everyone regardless of their background or experience level. Please actively work to make our community inclusive and help others feel comfortable contributing. We all started somewhere and we know how steep some learning curves can be.

* **Give constructive feedback**: Whether you're commenting on a pull request or discussing ideas in an issue, use welcoming and inclusive language. Recognize that others may have different perspectives and experiences. Focus on helping improve the work rather than criticizing mistakes. When receiving feedback, assume good intentions and accept critiques gracefully.

* **Align with project goals**: Contributions should move the project forward. Review the project's objectives and ensure your suggestions and work support those goals.

* **Keep it legal**: Share only content you have the right to share. Don't post private or sensitive information, and don't break the law.

* **Stay on topic**: Keep discussions focused on the relevant issue, pull request, or repository topic. Post to the appropriate repository and remember that off-topic content disrupts everyone's workflow.

## Enforcement

We handle violations on a case-by-case basis, but generally follow a three-strike approach for minor to moderate infractions. Severe violations involving threats, abuse, destructive behavior, or illegal activity will be addressed immediately and may result in immediate removal from the community.

### Three-Strike Guidelines

* **First occurrence**: You'll receive a friendly but public reminder that the behavior doesn't align with our Code of Conduct.

* **Second occurrence**: You'll receive a private message warning that further violations will result in removal from the community.

* **Third occurrence**: Depending on the severity, this may result in temporary or permanent removal from the community.

**Important notes:**

* Obvious spammers are removed immediately on first occurrence.
* Violations may be forgiven after 6 months of excellent behavior.
* Minor issues related to submissions (content, code, style...) will be handled with education rather than enforcement.
* All enforcement decisions are made on a case-by-case basis considering context and severity.

## Reporting Violations

If you experience or witness Code of Conduct violations, please contact the F5 DevCentral team or the maintainers of the specific repository. We take all reports seriously and will investigate fairly.

For appeals or if you believe there's been a misunderstanding, please reach out to the same contacts. We recognize that mistakes happen and will work with you to reach a fair resolution. Only Buu is perfect. We only let Chase have a keyboard under supervision.

## Our Commitment

We are committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. By participating in F5 DevCentral, you agree to uphold these standards and help us maintain a positive, productive community.
