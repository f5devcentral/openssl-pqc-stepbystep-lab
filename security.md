# Security Policy

Well we are an application delivery and security platform company so it would be silly not to support good practices with a security.md policy.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these guidelines:

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security issues by emailing **devcentralteam (at) f5 dot com** with the following information:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: The potential impact and severity
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have recommendations (optional)
- **Your Contact Information**: So we can follow up with questions

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, here's what happens:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt as soon as possible
2. **Initial Assessment**: We'll provide an initial assessment and respond back
3. **Updates**: We'll keep you informed as we investigate and develop a fix
4. **Resolution**: We aim to release updates according to severity

### Disclosure Policy

We practice **coordinated disclosure**:

- We'll work with you to understand and validate the issue
- We'll develop and test a fix
- We'll notify affected users appropriately
- We'll publicly disclose the vulnerability **after** a fix is available and users have had time to update (typically 30-90 days)
- We'll credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

While using this project, we recommend:

- Keep your dependencies up to date
- Use the latest supported version
- Monitor our security advisories for updates

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are published at:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: [Link to your GitHub Security tab]
- **Mailing List**: [Link to security mailing list if you have one]

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly **out of scope** for security reports:

- Issues in outdated/unsupported versions
- Social engineering attacks against our team
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without proof of exploitation
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (report those upstream)
- Issues requiring extensive user interaction or extremely unlikely scenarios

## Contact
